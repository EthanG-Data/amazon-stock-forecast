# Amazon Stock Forecast - Python Regression & ARIMA Modeling

This branch contains the complete code, data, and forecast results for the Amazon stock prediction project.
It implements and compares **Linear Regression** and **ARIMA (0,1,1)** models to forecast Amazon's weekly stock prices 73 weeks into the future. 

## Objective 
-The Goal of this analysis is to apply **statistical and time-series forecasting** techniques to evaluate Amazon's stock performance between 2023-2025 and project future price behavior. 
- Two Distinct modeling approaches -deterministic regression and stochastic ARIMA- are used to assess both trend and noise components in the data.


## Key Results

| Model | Performance | Insights |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Linear Regression | R² ≈ 0.80 | Captures steady long-term growth trend |
| ARIMA(0,1,1) | Lower MAE/RMSE | Better short-term volatility tracking |
| Combined | 73-week projection | Predicts sustained upward trajectory with mild fluctuations |
